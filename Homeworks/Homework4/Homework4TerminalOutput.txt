QUESTION 1

The Milky Way has a center-of-mass position vector of [-2.07  2.95 -1.45] kpc
and a velocity vector of [ 0.24 -0.26  0.02] km / s

M31 has a center-of-mass position vector of [-377.66  611.43 -284.64] kpc
and a velocity vector of [ 0.47 -0.27 -0.03] km / s

M33 has a center-of-mass position vector of [-476.22  491.44 -412.4 ] kpc
and a velocity vector of [-0.03  0.01  0.02] km / s

QUESTION 2

The separation between MW and M31 is 
769.098 kpc
The relative velocity of MW with respect to M31 is 
0.236 km / s

QUESTION 3

The separation between M33 and M31 is 
201.083 kpc
The relative velocity of M33 with respect to M31 is 
0.575 km / s

QUESTION 4

Using an iterative process to find the center of mass will be critical when
        stars between the Milky Way and Andromeda start mixing. Gravitational interactions
        will greatly increase the distance of some stars from the center, creating outliers
        that will skew the data, and an iterative method will remove them from the dataset
