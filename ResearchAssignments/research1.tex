\section{Galaxy Merger Sequence of MW and/or M31: stellar evolution
  through close encounters}
    
  \begin{itemize}
  \item how do the bars within both galaxies evolve? What happens to
    those bars after the merger?
  \newline

  I would imagine they dissipate, since elliptical galaxies don't have
  barred structures and the Milkomeda galaxy is expected to be
  elliptical. This relates closely to the velocity dispersion, at
  least around the core, so as this research question becomes more
  concrete, I could touch on answering other questions too. At any
  rate, I look forward to what I'll learn by probing into this
  question.
