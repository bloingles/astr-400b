Given R_o=8.34 kpc, the velocity of the local standard of rest is 239.932 km / s
Given R_o=8.178 kpc, the velocity of the local standard of rest is 235.034 km / s
Given R_o=7.9 kpc, the velocity of the local standard of rest is 226.628 km / s

The orbital period of the Sun is 0.203 Gyr

If the Sun were in a circular orbit around the Milky Way and were as old as the universe, it would have completed 67.918 revolutions
